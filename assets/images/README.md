# images

## Overview

One of the ways you might want to customize your image is by changing or
adding to the images that are used. By default the images in this folder
are fixed and used as the background of the desktop.

Snippet files control which images are added to the target. Generally speaking,
when images are added they are placed into the `/system/etc/images` folder
on the target.
